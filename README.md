What is this project?
In this project, I have added few GitHub profiles of my college batchmates! You can search them according to name and filter them using various buttons provided like Early Birds, Most Popular and Most Following! I have also added Boolean Search which is a really cool feature!

How to use?
1.Unzip the zip file and you will get a GitHubProFinder folder. Open it in any workspace of your choice, Visual Studio Code is recommended.
2.Before Starting the project, do npm install as .parcel-cache and node_modules have been deleted to reduce the size taken by the project.
3.After that it will be ready to run. Just do npm start and the project is running on a localhost!
